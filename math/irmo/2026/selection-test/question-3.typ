= 2026 Irish Maths Olympiad UCD Selection Test Question III

Let the functions $A$ and $B$ be defined as follows:
- $A : NN^2 -> NN^2 : (a, b) -> (a + 1, b)$
- $B: NN^2 -> NN^2 : (a, b) -> (3a + 2b, 4a + 3b)$

Is it possible to go from $(1, 1)$ to $(2025, 2025)$ using only the functions $A$ and $B$?

= 65th Mathematik-Olympiade Round 2 Question 4 - 11-12th Class

Let $S$ be a finite sequence of (not necessarily distinct) integers $a_1, dots, a_2026$.

Let an operation be defined on $S$ such that a number $a_i in S$ is replaced with $a_i + a_j$ for any (not necessarily different to $a_i$) number $a_j in S$.

The goal is to convert $S$ to an increasing sequence $x_1, x_2, x_3, dots, x_n$ such that $x_1 <= x_2 <= x_3 <= dots <= x_n$.

Let $k$ be the smallest number of steps such that you are guaranteed to be able to convert $S$ to an increasing sequence in at most $k$ steps.

== Part a)

If all $a_i >= 0$, find $k$.

== Part b)

If $-2026 <= a_i <= 2026$, prove that $k = 3043$.
